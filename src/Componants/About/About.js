<h4>
Change starts here. Change lives, change organizations, change the world. Our motto is more than words — ideas started here have fundamentally changed how the world works, connects, and lives. But there is another change a little less quantifiable — that internal change that occurs as students become leaders by challenging themselves intellectually, engaging and collaborating with their equally driven peers, and gaining global exposure.
